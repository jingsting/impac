Im(age) Pac(ker)

## Description

This project takes individual images and creates a sprite sheet or texture atlas. The goal of this project is to reduce load time when one needs to upload many images into an application or program. This is done by taking the images needed and placing them together in such a way that they fit into the smallest single image possible. This project is a command line tool and can be built on any platform.

## Running

After building the project, go to the build directory and run:
```
$ ./impac ./path/to/folder/of/images ./path/to/output
```

## Building

### Build Dependencies

- Compiler with C++17 support
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Magick++](https://imagemagick.org/Magick++/)
- [Boost.Filesystem](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm)

Installing dependencies on MacOS via `homebrew`:
```
$ brew update
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install boost
$ brew install imagemagick
```

Installing dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu via `apt`:
```
$ sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
$ sudo apt install libmagick++-dev
```

### Build Instructions

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

This generates a main executable named `impac` and test target named `test` under the build directory.
